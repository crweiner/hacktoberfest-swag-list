# Contributing

We'd love it if you could help make the Hacktoberfest Swag List even better. That's the spirit of open source after all!

By opening up a pull request to add a new company offering swag or to fix something, you'll also be banking towards earning your official Hacktoberfest t-shirt!

Check [Issues](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list/issues) and current [Pull Requests](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list/pulls) before contributing to avoid adding duplicates.

Please follow these rules regarding how to add a new company to the List:

## How to format your contribution

Make a [fork of this repo](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list/fork) and add the details for what company and swag you find in the [Readme.md](./README.md).

We are using a very simple language called Markdown to format this list. It's basically a way to make things look pretty without having to use a rich text editor. Please familiarize yourself with Markdown [using this handy cheat sheet provided by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

If you are adding a new company, be sure to add your company in two places:

### A to Z Order of Companies

Find the first letter of your company within the list, then add your information in the correct alphabetical order by using the following Markdown formatting:

```
#### **Company Name**
- **Swag**: (T-shirt, stickers, etc)
- **Requirements**: (What do I have to complete? Are there different requirements per swag item? Are the PRs merged or just submitted?)
- **How to sign up**: (Link to signup page using inline formatting of [text](URL))
- **Notes**: (If needed, otherwise write N/A)
```

 If you don't see a letter heading for your company, please add it! Use the Markdown formatting to do so:

```
### A
```

### Least Involvement to Most Involvement

Also add your company information to the correct section for this list. So far, the involvement scale is the following:

- Any - 1 PR
- 1 Merged PR
- 2 or more PRs
- 2 or more Merged PRs
- 5 Merged PRs
- Top Contributors

If your involvement requirements are a bit different or do not fit into this scale, feel free to create another level in the scale! Use the same Markdown formatting as a letter heading:

```
### Another Involvement Level
```

Depending on your involvement requirements, place your company within the appropriate section.

This section of the list will follow a slightly different set of formatting in order to make the requirements more prominant: 

```
#### **Company Name** (swag earned at this level)
- **Requirements**: If the company only offers one type of swag, then state the requirements here
  - If they offer multiple levels of swag, then record this particular swag item here as an indented bullet point
- **Swag**: (T-shirt, stickers, etc)
- **How to sign up**: (Link to signup page using inline formatting of [text](URL))
- **Notes**: (If needed, otherwise write N/A)
```

If you have multiple types of swag for different involvement levels, be sure to add two separate entries for each individual piece of swag earned! For example, Operation Code has two types of swag earned at different levels:

#### **Operation Code**
- **Requirements**:
  - Stickers and handwritten note: Simply get a pull request merged!
  - T-Shirt: Resolve 3 issues.

For each piece of swag, a separate entry was added at the appropriate involvement levels:

_1. For the Stickers and a handwritten note only (placed at 1 Merged PR level):_
```
#### **Operation Code** (Stickers and Handwritten Note)
- **Requirements**:
  - Stickers and a handwritten note: Simply get a pull request merged!
- **Swag**: T-shirt + handwritten note and stickers
- **How to sign up**: We're tracking it manually and will comment you a Google form.
- **Notes**: See the pinned repositories [here](https://github.com/OperationCode). You can find out more information about our all-volunteer, non-profit organization and our social media accounts via [our website](https://operationcode.org/).
```

_2. For the T-Shirt only (placed at 2 or more Merged PRs level):_
```
#### **Operation Code** (T-Shirt)
- **Requirements**:
  - T-Shirt: Resolve 3 issues.
- **Swag**: T-shirt + handwritten note and stickers
- **How to sign up**: We're tracking it manually and will comment you a Google form.
- **Notes**: See the pinned repositories [here](https://github.com/OperationCode). You can find out more information about our all-volunteer, non-profit organization and our social media accounts via [our website](https://operationcode.org/).
```
Note that the requirements have been edited for clarity, only showing the requirements for that type of swag and moved to the first bullet point. Also, the swag type is placed in parentheses after the company name to understand what is being earned at each level. 😊
