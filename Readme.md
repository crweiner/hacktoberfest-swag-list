![Hacktoberfest logo](docs/img/Hfest-Logo-2-Color-Manga.png)

Hello all you beautiful nerds and welcome to another year of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)! at the [Hacktoberfest Swag List](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com)

## [Click here to be taken to the 2022 Hacktoberfest Swag List!](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/list)

[As the official website states](https://hacktoberfest.com/#prepare-to-hack), Hacktoberfest is a time for everyone to celebrate open-source and come together to make meaningful contributions towards software and organizations you love. Whether this is your first Hacktoberfest or your 9th, everyone can contribute to making open-source software even better!

New for 2022, [low-code or no-code contributions are encouraged](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code), so everyone has a chance, regardless of skill level, to contribute and make open-source projects even better!

Also new for 2022, the Hacktoberest Swag List is now powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) instead of Jekyll. This means that the Swag List is more easily searchable, can support lite and dark modes, is still written in Markdown so everyone can participate no matter your skill level, and is easier to extend!

Please take a look at the new [Contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) file as the way to add organizations to the list has changed.

## What is the Hacktoberfest Swag List?

[The Hacktoberfest Swag List site](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list) are here to showcase all of the amazing companies that go above and beyond by offering their own swag for the holiday. **The goal of this project is to connect contributors to open-source projects that they might not have heard about before and drive traffic towards organizations that celebrate Hacktoberfest and can use a little more help.**

### This website/repo is not about collecting all of the swag you can. It is about the open-source community and highlighting organizations that purposely want to drive traffic to their projects during Hacktoberfest by offering unique swag.

### Swag is an added benefit of helping out these awesome organizations, not the reason for you to contribute in the first place!

Participating in Hacktoberfest requires following the [official values](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#values), including [**not spamming** the participating companies](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam).
